# Singly Linked List - Python Assignment

This project implements a **Singly Linked List** using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to:

- Add elements to the list
- Print the list
- Delete the **nth node** (user-defined)
- Handle edge cases like invalid indices or empty list deletions

---

## File

- `assignment 2.py` — Main Python file containing the linked list implementation.

---

## Features

1.Object-Oriented Design  
2.Exception Handling  
3. User Input for Deletion  
4. Edge Case Management  

---

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the program:

```bash
python "assignment 2.py"
```

4. You'll see the list printed.
5. You'll be asked which node you want to delete (1-based index).
6..You can continue deleting nodes or exit.

## Edge Case Handling

1. Tries to delete from an empty list ➤ Shows an error
2. Index is out of range ➤ Shows an error
3. User can choose to continue or stop deletion
